## Overview
Reach is a lightweight reachability framework. 
We designed Reach to be simple to use and also very flexible. Written on Swift 3.1 and compatible with:
  - iOS 8.0
  - macOS 10.10
  - tvOS 9.0
  - watchOS 2.0

## Features
- Super friendly API
- Singleton free
- No external dependencies
- Minimal implementation
- Support for `iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS/Linux`
- Support for CocoaPods/Carthage/Swift Package Manager

## Getting Started

Reach contains a status property to check the reachability from network. If you want to receive notifications from network changes, you can subscribe to `ReachDelegate` protocol. 

```swift
let reach = Reach()

reach.start()

print(reach.status)
```

You can check the `Reach.playground` to experimental with more examples. If need to see deeply information you can check our [Documentation](https://github.com/therapychat/Reach/docs)
